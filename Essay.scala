From 9 to 15 March 2016, 20 years after the remarkable victory of IBM's Deep Blue over world chess champion Garry Kasparov, AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google, won 4-1 in a five-game Go match versus the legendary Korean Go player Lee Sedol. While Deep Blue used a brute force approach, which is basically pre-calculating all the possible outcomes for every move and selecting the most reasonable one, AlphaGo can actually "think" and adjust as the game progresses. The most astonishing thing is AlphaGo had self-taught intuition, creation, and strategic thinking from more than 30 million Go games before the matches and was able to learn from its mistakes. Whether this sets a new milestone in technology development or not, the fact that a program can actually learn, think, and overwhelm humans in a complex game has raised the doubts about the potential threats of artificial intelligence (AI).
"Advancements in robotics and AI could put almost half of the world's population out of jobs in the coming 30 years," said Moche Vardi, professor of computational engineering at Rice University. He casted the future picture that will fall upon us: we are reaching the stage that machines will be capable of outperforming humans at almost any task. In fact, as reported by Ernst & Young, recruitment needs for university graduates in the audit and accounting sector is predicted to decrease to 50% by 2020 due to competition from AI. Companies will tend not to hire people to do simple tasks, but rather computer scientists that are able to develop algorithms to replace humans in those processes. According to City Bank, 35% jobs in England are potentially being replaced by machines, in China that figure is 77% and the world average is 57%. This can increase unemployment rate, leading to serious problems like deepening social inequality and causing major crises around the world.
Besides this, the application of AI in military is also controversial. In particular, AI can be exploited to automatically control military arsenals. Unmanned systems can help countries to fight without the loss of soldiers and precise calculations will help to increase chances for victory. However, military AI exploitation can lead to a global arms race with obvious risks of destruction and could be seriously detrimental to global economy. No one can foresee what would possibly happen and then the military AI systems can cause disastrous consequences.
Last but not least, the biggest concern about AI is its limits. AI combined with nanotechnology could be a significant step for science, but also may be the biggest threat to humans. It sounds fascinating to create robots and computers that can think like humans and can feed themselves from organic matters like plants and animals, but without an adequate amount of control, this arrival of human-like machines can be a deliberate threat to the existence of mankind. This may sound fictional, but the fact that AI, which already can perform calculations much faster and much more precise than humans, can now learn and think with incredible speed and efficiency is an indisputable proof that this idea is not only in fiction novels anymore.
Generally, the rapid development of AI has really aroused certain concerns. According to the recent surveys done by the website AIimpacts.org, there will be a 50% chance of human-level AI range between 2035 and 2050, and 90% in 2075. The scientific community is currently working on considering the risks that could affect the future of humankind, and these risks are hidden behind new technologies introduced everyday. OpenAI, for example, is an open source project founded by Elon Musk that uses community strength to control  AI and aims to develop friendly AI in such a way as to benefit rather than harmful to humanity. AI is one of the most brilliant inventions of humanity. The development of AI is driven by the development of human wisdom. As a matter of fact, humans will always use their inventions in good as well as bad purposes. The important point is that AI development must be planned to be sustainable and safe, not only to best promote its impact in the social life, but also to push human civilization forward.
