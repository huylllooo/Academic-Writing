Between 9 to 15 March 2016, 20 years after the remarkable victory of IBM's Deep Blue over world chess champion Garry Kasparov, AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google won 4-1 in a five-game Go match versus Korean legendary Go player Lee Sedol. While Deep Blue used brute force approach, which is basically pre-calculating all the possible outcomes for every moves and selecting the most reasonable one, AlphaGo can actually "think" and adjusting as the game goes. The most astonishing thing is AlphaGo had self-taught intuition, creation and strategic thinking from more than 30 millions Go games before the matches and is able to learn from its mistakes. Whether this sets a new milestone in technology development or not, the fact that a program can actually learn, think and overwhelm human in a complex game has raised the doubts about the potential threats of artificial intelligence (AI).
"Advancements in robotics and AI could put almost half of the world's population out of jobs in the coming 30 years" said Professor Moche Vardi, professor of computational engineering at Rice University. He casted the future picture that falling upon us: we are reaching the stage that machine will be capable of outperforming human at almost any work. In fact, as reported by Ernst & Young, recruitment needs for university graduated student in the audit and accounting sector is predicted to decrease to 50% in 2020 due to competition from AI. Companies will tend not to hire people to do simple tasks but computer scientists that be able to develop algorithms to replace humans in those processes. According to City Bank, 35% jobs in England are potentially being replaced by machines, in China is 77% and world average is 57%. This can increase unemployment rate, leads to serious problems like deepening social inequality and causes major crisis.
Besides, the application of AI in military is also controversial. In particular, AI can be exploited to automatically control military arsenals. Unmanned systems can help countries to fight without loss of soldiers and precises calculations will help to increase winning chances. However, military AI exploitation can lead to a global arms race with obvious risks of destruction and could be seriously detrimental to global economy. No one can foresee what would possibly happen and then the military AI systems can cause disastrous consequences.
Last but not least, the biggest concern about AI is its limits. AI combined with nanotechnology could be a significant step for science, but also maybe the biggest threat to humans. It sounds fascinating to create robots and computers that can think like humans and can feed themselves from organic matters like plants and animals. But without adequate amount of control, this arrival of human-like machines can be a deliberate threat to humankind existence. This may sounds fictional, but the fact that AI, which already can perform calculations much faster and much more precise than human, now can learn and think with incredible speed and efficiency is an indisputable proof that this idea is not in fiction novels only anymore.
Generally, the rapid development of AI really aroused certain concerns. According to the recent surveys done by the website AIimpacts.org, there will be a 50% chance of human-level AI range between 2035 and 2050, and 90% in 2075. The scientific community is currently working on considering the risks can affect the future of humankind hidden behind new technologies introduced everyday. OpenAI, for example, is an open source project founded by Elon Musk that uses community streng to control over AI, aims to develop friendly AI in such a way as to benefit rather than harmful to humanity. AI is one of the most brilliant inventions of humanity. The development of AI is driven by the development of human wisdom. As the matter of fact, humans will always use their inventions in good as well as bad purposes. The important point is, AI development must be planned to be sustainable and safe, not only to best promote its impact in the social life but also to push human civilization forward.
